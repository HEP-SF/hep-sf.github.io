Training in software and computing are essential ingredients for the success of any HEP experiment. As most experiments have similar basic prerequisites (Unix shell, Python, C++, â€¦) we want to join our efforts and create one introductory software training curriculum that serves HEP newcomers the software skills needed as they enter the field, and in parallel, instill best practices for writing software.

The curriculum is comprised of a set of standardized *modules*, so that students can focus on what is most relevant to them. More about the style of these modules is written in the [guidelines for training material](/training/module-guidelines.html).

## The modules

### Beginner level

## Contributing

Contributions of any kind are very welcome! There are various ways you can get involved:

* Join our meetings to give feedback and discuss with us (details at our [main page](/workinggroups/training.html))
* Bugs reports or features requests: Directly open an issue on github or (even better) submit a pull request to fix things.
* Want to contribute your own module? We compiled a small list of recommendations [here](/training/module-guidelines.html). Of course we always encourage you to talk to us early for a better coordination.
