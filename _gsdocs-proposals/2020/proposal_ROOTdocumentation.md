## Description of project idea

The ROOT system [1] [2] is the main data analysis and data presentation tool used in high
energy physics world-wide. More than 1 exabyte of data are stored in the ROOT format.

ROOT is being made available under the LGPL 2.1+, which allows
ROOT to be used in a wide range of open and closed environments.

ROOT it is written in C++ with dynamic Python bindings. Thanks to its
capabilities and performance it is also used in industry.

ROOT's documentation and web site are a key parts of the ROOT project [6]. They are
evolving in parallel and complement each other. The basis is the reference Guide [4]
documenting all the ROOT C++ components. A large set of tutorials [5], helping to
enter the ROOT world, is also provided. And finally a "Manual"
guides users trough the ROOT tools and concepts [7].

## Tasks

 Possible tasks might include:

- Because ROOT's documentation is mainly physics-oriented, it is more
  difficult for non-physicists to pick up ROOT. The Manual should address this.
- Documentation of Python bindings in the reference guide.
- Series of new "tutorial for modern analysis" is needed to illustrate the
  functionalities provided by ROOT 7.
- Technical specifications for the new data format RNTuple.

## Project duration

This is expected to be a long (6 months) project which will possibly continue
after this period.

## Expected results

The deliverables of the projects will be directly visible online
in the various area mentioned in the "Tasks" paragraph. The writers
will directly commit his work as pull requests to the web site repository.
