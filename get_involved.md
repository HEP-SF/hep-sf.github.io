# How to get involved

Our goal is to make every effort going on as transparent and open as possible.
Our official communication channel is the 
[hsf-forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-forum). 

See the [dedicated page](/forums.html) about HSF discussions forums for 
information about how to register and the
other existing discussion forums.

## Areas for contribution

There are plenty of opportunities for you to contribute to the HSF, be it by
participation in technical discussions, by joining one of our working groups, or
by joining the HSF with your software project:

  *  Participation in HSF activities and forums. See the Activities page.
  *  Participation in HSF events and meetings.
  *  Contributing to the [HEP S&C Knowledge Base](http://hepsoftware.org)
  *  Taking advantage for your project from the HSF (to be created)
  *  Giving input to the HSF startup team
  *  Contributing to this website

## Meetings, Agendas and Video-Conferences Access

See the Events listing on this site for information on HSF meetings, workshops,
etc. Meetings use the [CERN Indico system](http://indico.cern.ch/category/5816/) for agenda pages. The agenda pages are open to the world, and no CERN account needed. The Vidyo video conferencing system is used for all HSF meetings and anyone can participate in the meetings from any internet-connected location. 
Connection information for each specific Vidyo meeting is on the corresponding Indico meeting agenda page.  Vidyo has a web-browser interface, or alternatively one can [download the Vidyo desktop client (standalone application)](http://information-technology.web.cern.ch/services/fe/howto/users-install-vidyo-desktop-client).  However should you need to upload material to the
agenda, a CERN account is needed. CERN provides lightweight accounts to non CERN
affiliated people when needed. See <https://account.cern.ch/account/Externals/>

## Giving input to the HSF Coordination Team

If you are not comfortable with raising an issue in the
[forums](/forums.html) or if you are afraid that this is not the
right place for it, feel free to contact the
[HSF coordination team](mailto:hsf-coordination@googlegroups.com) directly.

## Contributing to this website

## Add events to the community calendar

See [this short guide](/calendar.html) for how to add next events to the calendar.


## Contributing to the HSF S&C Knowledge Base

The HSF provides a S&C knowledge base at 
[hepsoftware.org](http://hepsoftware.org) cataloging software in use by the 
community, who uses it, etc. The knowledge base relies on community input if it 
is to become comprehensive and useful. Please add, update, elaborate, correct 
entries for your favorite software packages, experiments, etc. All are welcome 
and encouraged to add and edit material.
