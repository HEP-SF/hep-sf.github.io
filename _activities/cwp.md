# Community White Paper (CWP) 

## A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s

Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments 
over the next 10 years will require the HEP community to address a number of 
challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that
the computing models will need to evolve and a significant "software 
upgrade" is required to prepare.
In order to identify and prioritize the software research and development 
investments required, we are now beginning a community planning process. The 
aim
is to produce a Community White Paper 
(CWP) which will describe the community strategy and a roadmap for 
software and computing R&D in HEP for the 2020s. This activity is organised under 
the umbrella of the HSF. The LHC experiments and HSF have been 
specifically [charged by the WLCG project](/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf) and
we are reaching out to other HEP experiments around the world to participate.

## Final Roadmap Paper

The aim is to produced the final CWP by December 15, 2017.
The first draft of the CWP, the [Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rcPIJQc3LNAh5tjHKjfuq80StrMO5ksiLwhDlJzeg9U/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_cwp_roadmap"} 
report, has been released to the community for comment (also available in [pdf](/assets/HSF-Community-White-Paper-v0.1.pdf), also available with [line numbers](/assets/HSF-Community-White-Paper-v0.1-linenumbers.pdf)).

**Comments are welcome directly on the Google Doc** or by email to [hsf-cwp-ed-board@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-cwp-ed-board@googlegroups.com).
To comment on the Google Doc, please **login with an account known to the 
[hsf-sf-forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hep-sf-forum){:target="_forum_googlegroup"} group**, so that anonymous comments are avoided.

We also started to collect signatures for the CWP with the aim of having it signed by every person in the community who gives it their broad support.
If, based on the current draft, you are willing to be one of the signatory, please add your name to the dedicated 
[Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tBXwlNnQsxxZA3gVS1_KSpa8wRXGyk250EIsJwJ2T34/edit#){:target="_cwp_signatories"} (or contact the 
[CWP Editorial Board](mailto:hsf-cwp-ed-board@googlegroups.com)).

The planned timeline to the final CWP is:

* November 10: first draft closed for comments
* November 17: release of the CWP second draft for comments
* December 1: second draft closed for comments
* December 13: deadline for the initial list of signatories
* December 15: release of the final CWP

## Communication

To join the CWP process and get information about its progress, please join the [hsf-community-white-paper](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-community-white-paper) Google group (no Google account is required, you can register by sending an email to [hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-community-white-paper+subscribe@googlegroups.com)). Subscribing to this group with a Google account is required if you want to be able to contribute to CWP documents hosted in Google Docs. Individual working groups may also have their own list or google group (see below).

## CWP Process

The CWP process has involved a number of workshops between January and Summer 2017. As part of the process members of the community have been encouraged to write white papers to describe their ideas on the various topics. White papers can be submitted by anyone: individuals, groups of individuals, experiments, institutions, etc.

We maintain a [list of contributed CWP whitepapers](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp-whitepapers.html).

If you have a white paper which you would like to contribute to the CWP process, please submit it (in pdf or link form, e.g. in the arXiv) to hsf-cwp-white-paper-submission@googlegroups.com and it will add be added to this list.

Some guidance and suggestions for WGs can be found here:

  * [Guidance for WGs at HSF workshop at SDSC](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-wg-guidance-sdsc.html)

## Other notes

The timeline for producing a CWP by summer, 2017, corresponds roughly to
the plan for [CERN openlab](http://openlab.cern/) to produce a similar white paper describing the plans for their next phase beginning in January, 2018. We expect that the CWP process and CERN openlab planning processes will be synergistic.
