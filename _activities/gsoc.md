## Introduction

[Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) is a program that allows students to contribute to development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations.

Particle physics is an exciting field where large collaborations of scientists collect 
and analyze petabytes data from high-energy physics experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider, 
hosted at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. 
Some of the questions that we collectively ask are: 

- what are the fundamental blocks that make up our Universe? 
- what is the nature of dark matter and dark energy?
- what is the nature of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter? 
- what was early Universe like? 

To answer these questions, particle physicists build software to simulate and analyze what happens in particle physics detectors.

The CERN software for experiments (CERN-SFT) group has participated in the GSoC since 2011. 
Since 2017 the program has expanded to involve the high-energy physics community under the umbrella of the HEP Software Foundation.

Information from last year's GSoC can be found [here](/gsoc/2017/index.html). For 2018 the 
HSF is again applying for participation in the program. If you are 
interested in the GSoC program contact us using the HSF GSoC mailing list: [hep-software-foundation-google-summer-of-code@googlegroups.com](mailto:hep-software-foundation-google-summer-of-code@googlegroups.com).

Instructions for participating projects and mentors can be found [here](/gsoc/guideline.html).

## Projects in 2018
