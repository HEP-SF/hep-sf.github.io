# PyHEP "Python in HEP" Series of Workshops

The **PyHEP workshops** are a new series of workshops initiated and supported by the HSF
with the aim to provide an environment to discuss and promote the usage of Python in the HEP community at large.


## PyHEP 2018

The first workshop, **PyHEP 2018**, will be held as a pre-CHEP event in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 7-8 July 2018, just before the start of the [CHEP 2018 conference](http://chep2018.org/). It will focus on a review of where and how Python is used in our community, and what the future will hold.
The workshop will be a forum for the participants, representatives of the community, to discuss topics around the areas of work identified in the HSF [Community White Paper](/activities/cwp.html). There will be ample time for discussion.

A keynote presentation on [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/){:target="_pyhep2018_jupyterlab"}
will be given by [Vidar Tonaas Fauske](https://www.simula.no/people/vidar){:target="_pyhep2018_vidar"}.

The [agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/694818/){:target="_pyhep2018_indico"} will be composed of plenary sessions dedicated to the following topics:

1. Historical perspective and overview
2. PyROOT and Python bindings
3. HEP python software ecosystem
4. Distribution and installation
5. Analysis frameworks
6. Python 2 and 3
7. Open discussion on education and training

There won't be any training sessions or hackathons in this first workshop,
but some level of tuition will come in small bites in the various presentations,
which will try and be educative, not just informative, with well-defined examples relevant to the topics under discussion.
One of the goals of this PyHEP workshop will be to identify training workshops or hackathons the community would like to have in the future.
