The HSF frameworks group organises common discussions and developments
in the area of experiment software frameworks. The background to this
work is the chapter on frameworks in the [Community White Paper](/organization/cwp.html).

The group's meeting page is [in Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/10287/) and
discussions are held on the [hsf-tech-forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21forum/hsf-tech-forum) list.
