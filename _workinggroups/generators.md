The Physics Generators Working Group is a common forum for discussion and
technical work on the physics event generators used by HEP experiments.
It promotes the collaboration of experimental and theoretical physicists
from different experiments and generator teams and of software and computing
engineers, with the aim of having them work together on improving the current
codes and production workflows and on making new theoretical advances
easier to implement in a computationally efficient way.

The working group was set up as a follow-up of the Physics Event Generator
Computing Workshop that was held at CERN in November 2018, during which
an initial program of work in this area was identified.

The working group is currently coordinated by Andrea Valassi,
Josh McFayden, Stefan Hoeche, Steve Mrenna and Taylor Childers.
All coordinators can be reached
via <hsf-generator-wg-convenors@googlegroups.com>.

The mailing list for all WG members is <hsf-generator-wg@googlegroups.com>.
