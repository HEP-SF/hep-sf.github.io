The Software/Developer Tools Working Group aims to help HEP community in developing the latest and modern feature-rich projects
with the help of software tools such as code editors, static/dynamic code analyzers, compilers, debuggers, performance analyzers and so on.
The group plans to accomplish this by mainly serving as a forum where developers can share their experiences, discuss new/existing tools they utilize,
and learn from each other. To that point, contributions from the entire community are strongly encouraged.

The group is currently coordinated by Giulio Eulisse (CERN, EP-AIP-SDS), Alaettin Serhan Mete (UC Irvine, ATLAS), and Martin Ritter (LMU, Belle II).
All coordinators can be reached at <hsf-tech-forum@googlegroups.com>.
