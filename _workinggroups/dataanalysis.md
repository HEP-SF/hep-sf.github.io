The Data Analysis Working Group aims to eliminate time spent by physicists working on monotonous and laborious tasks while performing physics analysis, and make the publication of physics results efficient both in terms of human and computing resources.  To this end, the group will prioritise capturing the requirements of physics analysis across the HEP domain, aiming to gain a detailed understanding of the needs of physicists by direct consultation. Participation of those people actively involved in writing data analysis software, especially those with experience of publishing several analyses, will be critical to the groupâ€™s success. As a close second priority, the group will work with pioneers of technology, both inside and outside of the HEP community. The goal is to build bridges between physics analysis experts and technical innovators, fostering collaboration between these two communities to produce optimal solutions to a well-defined set of problems.
