The Data Analysis Working Group considers developments and approaches
that will make the analysis of HEP data towards final physics results
faster and more scalable in the future. One new approach to be
considered is the development of expressive functional interfaces for
analysis. The meshing of HEP specific tools with those found in the
larger data science community is another area of interest, where
database approaches or formats optimised for high-speed processing may
be profitable. The development of test beds for high performance
analysis clusters, that may speed-up turn-around and efficiency is a
major area of R&D. The group should help coordinate activities and
communication here between experiments and IT experts. The integration
of such systems into the end-to-end data flow, with caching and
distribution policies, are important. Optimising the actual content of
analysis formats is a boundary condition to discuss with physics groups,
but can bring major gains.
