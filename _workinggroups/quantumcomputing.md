# The HSF Quantum Computing working group

## Introduction

The Quantum Computing Working Group fosters collaboration among the HEP experiments and institutes to exploit the possibilities offered by quantum computing.

Quantum computing is a very active research field and prototype computers, simulators, and toolkits are now available. The participants in the working group share experiences, ideas, know-how, demonstrators, code snippets, and documents with the aim of fostering common research and development in this field, for the benefit of the HEP community.

Kick-starters: *Riccardo Maria BIANCHI* (ATLAS), *Sebastien BINET* (LSST, ALICE, LPC), *Riccardo DI SIPIO* (ATLAS), *Lukas HEINRICH* (ATLAS), *Maurizio PIERINI* (CMS)
