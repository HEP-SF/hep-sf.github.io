# Description

[Sherpa](https://gitlab.com/sherpa-team/sherpa) is a Monte Carlo event generator for the Simulation of High-Energy Reactions of PArticles in lepton-lepton, lepton-photon, photon-photon, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions.  It provides some of the most precise simulations of physics signatures at the LHC and is widely used by the LHC experiments.

The project will focus on a careful analysis of the code and a detailed performance profile, mostly at the level of single-nodes. This will form the baseline for the construction of an exascale optimisation roadmap of critical components of the overall simulation framework, on the basis of generic strategies like serialization of underlying data structures, reordering of data access and the avoidance of scattered memory accesses.
