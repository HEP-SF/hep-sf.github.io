## Description

Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter to better understand its underlying nature. Deep learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate WIMP particle dark matter from other well motivated models, including vortex substructure of dark matter condensates and superfluids.

This project will focus on further development of the pipeline that combines state-of-the art of deep learning models with strong lensing simulations initially based on PyAutoLens for strong gravitational lens modeling.


## Task ideas
 * Expand the DeepLense functionality to include interfaces to additional dark matter simulation tools
 * Optimize and improve the interface to PyAutoLens
 * Expand the unsupervised modeling suite in DeepLens 


## Requirements
Python, C++, and some previous experience in Machine Learning.
