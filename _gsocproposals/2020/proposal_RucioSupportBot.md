## Description

Rucio is an open source software framework that provides scientific collaborations with the functionality to organize, manage, and access their volumes of data. Data in Rucio is organized using Data Identifiers (DIDs) which have three levels of granularity viz.: files, datasets and containers, respectively. Datasets are used to group a set of files to facilitate bulk operations on them eg. in transfers, deletions, and organizational purposes. Users are permitted to perform certain actions on the DIDs such as downloads, uploads, transfers, etc. Expert support, through different escalation levels, is offered to the users in case of problems. In case when satisfying answers were not found at previous support levels, a request from a user or a group of users can reach the Rucio support. Due to the vast amount of support requests, we are looking into methods to assist the support team in answering these requests. Ideally, the support would be provided by an intelligent bot able to process and understand the userâ€™s requests and finally trigger appropriate action. 
The Native Language Processing (NLP) is fairly developed technique used nowadays in many fields with need of analyzing large chunks of text and automate actions on them. Next to a few other use cases in Rucio project, an important one is to process responses and questions from users and to provide satisfying answers. That could be achieved by development of a prototype of a bot that is capable to handle the user's requests which don't exceed certain complexity. The request would be handled by experts only in case when the bot can not provide a reliable answer. Such a complex task consists of the following milestones.

## Milestones for GSoC Student

 * Input Data: 
   * Creation of corpora or use of existing one.
   * Getting emails from the support mailing lists, preferably through IMAP client.
 * Extraction of the meanings of the input data and acquiring the data for further analyses, preferably with the NLTK.
   * Creation of a training set and valdiation set from the input data. 
   * Development of a tool capable to extract the meanings.

## Ideas for Extension

 * Sorting out possible solutions from provided sources (e.g. documentation, docstrings, table of answers) and triggering a response to the user.
 * Fallback to the Rucio experts in case that no answer could be found.
 * Analysis of the acquired data:
   * Feedbacks from users.
   * Data popularity.
   * Most frequent questions/answers.

## Expected Results

Note that the whole Rucio Bot project demands full engagement for the time period longer than the GSoC timescale. The essential requirement for declaring success of the work of a GSoC student are explicitly written in the section of 'Milestones'. Especially the second bullet requires deep expertise with NLTK including creation of both the training set and the validation set and running the developed bot on them. The validation set provides us with the neccessary statistics necessary to demonstrate the reliability of the bot. 

Achievable, but not mandatory, developments are listed in the section 'Ideas for Extension'.

## Requirements

A candidate suitable for this project should be a good python programmer. Previous experience with NLTK, ML and data analysis is appreciated. The mentor will help the student with understanding the key concepts of the Rucio and the NLTK for the knowledge that is necessary for this project.
