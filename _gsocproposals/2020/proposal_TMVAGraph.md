# Description

Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA) is a multi-purpose machine learning toolkit integrated into the ROOT scientific software framework, used in many particle physics data analysis and applications. We have expanded TMVA's capabilities to include a deep learning library (DNN) supporting fully-connected, convolutional and recurrent architectures. This summer we would like to expand the toolkit with a graph neural network (GNN) library on CPU and GPU. GNNs are currently used by many promising applications in particle physics in physics analysis classification, calorimetry reconstruction, particle tracking and triggering systems, allowing physicists to use new techniques to identify particles and search for new physics. Additionally, they are useful for detector simulation.
