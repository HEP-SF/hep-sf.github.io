## Description

The GPU develompement and evolution of the last years has shown a much stronger peak performance growth with respect to CPUs. 
The performance growth, driven mainly by technological improvements in the transistor’s sizes, forced hardware producers to introduce hardware 
and low level software functionalities capable of enabling the GPU partitioning “à la CPU”.

Such solutions (e.g. AMD MxGPU, Nvidia vGPU) are currently available in payware environments such as VMware and CITRIX, while these are not available inside Linux KVM. 

Aim of the project is to develop a layer capable of presenting a common interface on top of such technologies in the open-source Linux KVM environment.


## Task ideas
 * Implement 1
 * Implement 2
 * Explore 3
 * Design and develop 4
 * Perform tests with real code.

## Expected results
Working implementation of a something.

## Requirements
Bash, Python (C++ optional but appreciated), familiar with Linux environment (bonus skill: KVM, ESXi) and virtualization techniques
