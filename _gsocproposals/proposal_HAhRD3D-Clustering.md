## Description

The challenge of this project is to evaluate new algorithms to classify 
objects from 3D images-like coming from the data acquisition of the [future 
sub-detector of CMS](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2020886). This detector 
that contains about 6 million channels will be used to reconstruct the 3D 
clusters from hundreds of impinging particles arising from the proton-proton 
collisions within the Large Hadron Collider. Image processing technologies 
are obviously promising candidates to tackle this challenge as well as 
Machine Learning  tool suite. The efficiency of the implementation is 
important as well as getting criteria of the classification quality.  

## Task ideas and expected results
 * Start with the original source code and data
 * Choose a new strategy/algorithm with physicists and computer scientists
 * Implement the new strategy and test it
 * Expected results : eliminate bad strategies and identify a set of 
   potential good candidates.

## Requirements
Solid knowledge on machine learning or image processing, solid/good statistics 
background, good C++/C skills, familiar with GPUs if possible, 
visualization tools.
