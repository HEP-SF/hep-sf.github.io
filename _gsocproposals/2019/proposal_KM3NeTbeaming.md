## Description

KM3NeT will house two next-geneneration underwater neutrino
experiments. Two detectors are being constructed at two deep sites in
the Mediterrenean Sea, one of the coast of Sicily and the other south
of Toulouse in Southern France,

Neutrino's traversing the earth sometimes interact with material in
the ground or atmosphere to produce a muon or electron. The KM3NeT
detectors search for the signature of light emitted by these muons and
electrons as they traverse the its volumes.

One of the main algorithms that is used to detect such electrons and
muons assumes many possible directions they might originate from.  It
first transforms the orientation and position of the detectors'
sensors, and then searches for signatures of emitted light that match
electrons and muons.
