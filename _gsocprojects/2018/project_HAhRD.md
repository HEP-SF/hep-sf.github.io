HPC Algorithms for high Resolution Detectors (HAhRD). The aim of this project is to investigate new methods based on statistics, Machine Learning, and/or image processing for high resolution detectors of sub-detectors in HEP. In addition, the studied algorithms must have all the good properties (parallel and vectorized) to run efficiently on extensible processor and GPU platforms (High Performance Computing). This project will be achieved with a strong collaboration with physicists.
