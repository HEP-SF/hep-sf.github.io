  [MCnet](http://montecarlonet.org) is a collaboration of the major collider event modelling tools used at the [Large Hadron Collider](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) (LHC) and beyond. These so-called "MC event generators" are theoretical physics tools that evaluate and sample from quantum mechanical distributions, to create simulated particle collisions that help to design and interpret the experimental data-taking. MCnet projects include both event generators themselves, and tools that connect them to both experiment and theory.  ---
