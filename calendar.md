The HSF [Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Amsterdam)
can be edited by people in the [HSF Startup Team](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hep-sf-startup-team)
Google Group.

The most straight forward way to do this is to 

- go to your [Google Calendar page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar)
- select *Other Calendars* -> *Add by URL*
- add the [following URL](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

```
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
```

Then you will have the ability to view events in the community 
calendar and, if you are in the startup
team group, add them. 

Please ask to join the startup
team if you would like to add events. 
You can join the startup team then disable email notifications
if you don't wish to be troubled by the other traffic on the list.
