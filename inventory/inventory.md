# Community Projects

The HSF is currently compiling an inventory of community software projects.

For the moment we continue to gather information on projects as part of
the [HEP Software and Computing Knowldge Base](http://www.hepsoftware.org/?popupmode=Software&popupstate=cat).

If you know of a particularly useful or critical software package then
please [add it to the knowledge base](http://hepsoftware.org/?e=wenaus.201510251113185035029&detailmode=Entity&detailstate=on)
or [let us know about it](mailto:hsf-coordination@googlegroups.com).
