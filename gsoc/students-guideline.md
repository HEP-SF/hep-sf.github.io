# Guideline for Students

### First steps

Get started checking out the [Google Summer of Code Guides for students](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/) and the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) of the program.

### How to apply to CERN-HSF

1. Take a look at the [list of projects](/activities/gsoc.html#projects-in-2019) participating for this year.
  * There you will find a list of proposals for each project, their descriptions and the contact information of their mentors.
  * There is also a list with [all the project proposals](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/2019/summary.html) sorted in alphabetical order.
  <!-- Next <br><br>, add an extra new line, otherwise there is no space between point 2 and previous nested bullet  -->
  <br><br>
2. Once you have chosen one or more proposals that you like, please contact the corresponding mentors and they will guide you through the next steps.

<br><br>
3. Mentors will typically ask you to complete a technical test to evaluate if you have the skills required for the project.
  * Please note that the vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge; in case of doubt, ask the mentors.
  * If you do well in the tests, mentors will usually ask you to write a description for your proposal and help you with the submission.
