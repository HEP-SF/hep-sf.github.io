The HSF's mission is to encourage cooperation and common projects
between all parts of the high-energy physics community concerned
with software. We span regions and experiments and we strive to 
to make our community's software development more effective.
To that end, the HSF will happily cooperate with any project that
shares similar goals. 

### Letters of Cooperation

We will be happy to provide a *letter of cooperation*
that can be used for any funding application. To ask us
for this please:

- Send an email request to [HSF Coordination](mailto:hsf-coordination@googlegroups.com)
- Include an outline of your project's goals and indicate where you
  believe that the HSF can usefully cooperate with you
- Please make this request at least *two weeks* before you need the letter

### Letters of Support

If you would like a *letter of support* for your project then you
should additionally show how your project will help to meet the goals
of the HSF as set out, for example, in the [Community White Paper](/organization/cwp.html).
Please note that a letter of support will not be exclusive for any
particular grant application round - the HSF is free to support multiple
projects.

- Send an email request to [HSF Coordination](mailto:hsf-coordination@googlegroups.com)
- Include an outline of your project's goals and indicate in what way
  this helps the high-energy physics community to meet the software challenges
  of the future
- Please make this request at least *three weeks* before you need the letter

### Procedure

In both cases the HSF Coordination group will discuss the request and, if approved,
circulate a draft letter to the whole of the HSF community for any comments. We will
then approve the request in an HSF Coordination meeting (or, exceptionally, just by email,
should deadlines not fit with the meeting schedule).
