## Preamble

In the first few meetings of 2021 the HSF established some high-level
plans and goals for 2021. While none of these are cast in stone, we
remain agile to adapt to new opportunities and circumstances throughout
the year, they are a useful guide to our activities.

We encourage experiments and projects to take a look at these and
we welcome any suggestions about how to make the HSF more effective
and useful for HEP.

## Overall Activity and Coordination

*Reference: 7 January 2021 [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/981562/contributions/4134317/attachments/2167697/3659044/HSF%202020-2021%20Review%20and%20Planning.pdf) 
and [meeting minutes](/organization/2021/01/07/coordination.html).*

### Meeting Series

* Continue with regular [coordination meetings](/meetings/coordination.html) every 2 weeks (on the odd-numbered weeks of the year by default).
* Monthly [*Software and Computing Roundtable*](/meetings/roundtable.html) is an ideal place to speak to the Nuclear Physics community (BNL and JLab co-organise), but we should make sure the series is known to not be only NP and is more widely known.
* Also monthly, the [Compute Accelerator Forum](/meetings/compute-accelerator-forum.html) made a very good start last year and attracts a lot of interest - good that it's co-organised with SIDIS and openlab.

### Workshops

* Although we had two successful workshops in 2020, there is a real sense of zoom-fatigue in the community.
  * Therefore we will not organise any large workshops in the first half of 2021.
  * There is a slot for a possible workshop at the end of September (w/b 27 Sept), but we don't yet take a firm decision on that.

* We will consider more 'one-shot' mini-workshops that cover topics which bridge between working groups, e.g., I/O matters that touch analysis, frameworks and facilities.

### Organisational Engagement

* We already have quite a long list of organisations with which we have a link or some engagement (see slide 11).
  * Keep this up and be alert for additional opportunities.
  * In particular in the next ~year the Snowmass process will be important (this has been delayed by a year).

### Software Projects

* It can be useful for projects to be associated with the HSF (e.g., listed as a project or
  making use of our GitHub organisation).
  * We should be alert to these opportunities, particularly when the working groups
    can identify areas of common interest or tools that can expand their user base.

### Post-CWP and LHCC

* As we prepare activity for the year we should not forget to look back to the
  [Community White Paper](/organization/cwp.html) and see which plans there were
  put into place, by the HSF directly or in other contexts.

* We already did some of that in preparing last year's [LHCC review document](https://zenodo.org/record/4009114).
  * This year Graeme and Liz have a role for the HSF/WLCG again in this process, so we remind people this can still be useful.
